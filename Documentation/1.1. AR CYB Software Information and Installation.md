# Downloading the Project

* Hardware requirements
  
  * Minimum: This project will run on a in Unity Editor without any other devices; but it's meant to run with Arduino and Hololenses (or other MRTK-compatible AR/VR devices).
  
  * Intended: This project is optimized to be run on Windows PC (in Unity Editor, or built for Standalone or UWP) with a connected Arduino, and on multiple Hololens 2 (UWP) devices
  
  * Optional: It has been used (after modification) on Android mobile and on iOS mobile, in multiplayer mode together with a Windows PC and Hololens users. It can probably also work on iOS built as Unity Standalone.ification) on Android mobile and on iOS mobile, in multiplayer mode together with a Windows PC and Hololens users. It can probably also work on iOS built as Unity Standalone.

* Suggestions before you start:
  
  * If you plan to use Arduino, it’s suggested you use an Arduino Uno device (because the examples will be configured for that)
  
  * This project uses MRTK. If you plan to deploy on Hololens 2, it’s suggested that you just start with making & deploying a basic MRTK project to your Hololens by following the  [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/beginner-hololens-2-tutorials/) . That way you get an understanding of tools, MRTK, and the deployment pipeline before tackling this project. NOTE - we are using MRTK 2.4

* Download the prerequisite tools
  
  * Required for any platform:
    
    * Unity LTS 2020.3.35f1 from: [https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases) 
  
  * If working with Arduino: download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
  
  * If working with Hololens2:
    
    * Tools for deploying to Hololens 2 (*you will not need the Emulator, but you will definitely need Unity and Visual Studio configured properly) [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/install-the-tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/install-the-tools) 

* Download or clone the Git repository from here (where you are reading these instructions)

* Open the Unity project and example scene, and follow the instructions for running: [2.1 Example Sample Scenes](/Documentation/2.1%20Sample%20Scenes.md)

# Read before Running the Application

### Things you will need to do in Unity before you start

* This project uses Photon for networking. You will need to change the Photon App ID (accessed in the Photon “Highlight Network Settings” menu) to a new one that you get from the Photon dashboard [https://dashboard.photonengine.com/](https://dashboard.photonengine.com/)

### Running multiple users

* Multiplayer info
  
  * This project uses Photon for networking and uses a server-client model for managing the multiplayer actions.
  * The project is meant to run on one main computer running the project in Unity Editor (the server, or what Photon calls the ‘master client’), and 0 or more other clients (typically on AR/VR devices)

* You can test multiple users in either of these forms:
  
  * One user on your computer in Unity Editor and 1+ users in the Hololens.
  * Two users on your computer (one in Unity Editor, and the other built in Standalone version)
  * Two users on different computers (run through Unity Editor on two computers)

* Things to remember to keep the users and their scenes synchronized:
  
  * All users will join the same scene. So, **the scene must be listed in the Scenes list of the Unity project**, under the project’s Build Settings, before building it for all users.
  
  * If you make changes to the scene or make a new scene, you’ll need to rebuild the app for all users.
  
  * All users will need to have their projects configured with the same Photon App ID (in the Photon settings), otherwise they will be in different Photon games and they won’t see each other. 
  
  * While running the app, before doing any activity in the game, all users must be connected. Otherwise things like creating 3D models through the menus may not synchronize for users that join the game late.

## Basic user interface

* There's a little network display window that follows the unity camera; if it's blue it means Photon connected properly, if it's purple it means there's a problem with networking and you should just restart the unity simulation (i think this is a photon bug)

* On AR/VR devices, you can use your hands from a distance to manipulate objects through the hand laser pointer, or by reaching for objects when you're close to them.

* On PC, you can move around and interact by using the MRK Keyboard controls (ASWD, space, shift, control, etc).

* To interact with game objects you will need to be in Creation mode (it's the default mode), either by using the virtual hand to push on the "Create" button that's hovering in the scene (or by clicking the "C" button on the PC GUI - this will only change the PC mode, not the mode of other users)

* To interact wih the values of data channels you can use the ManualDataChannel to modify a channel’s value.

### Known issues

* Photon connectivity
  
  * There's a little network display window that follows the unity camera; if it's blue it means Photon connected properly, if it's purple it means there's a problem with networking
    * This happens when the current scene isn’t in the Scenes in Build list. When building the project, the scene you’re working in has to be in the Build Settings > Scenes in Build.
    * This sometimes happens if the project took too long to start (in that case, just restart it)

* Sending data to Arduino
  
  * When Unity sends too many messages, sometimes it sends multiple messages concatenated together or fragmented, and Arduino doesn’t receive them properly. {I think this is a threading issue in the SerialController class}
  
  * When Unity sends a serial message, it will also receive the same message. {I think this is an issue in the SerialController class}
