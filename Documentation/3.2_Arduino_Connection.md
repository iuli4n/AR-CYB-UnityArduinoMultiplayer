# 3.2. Arduino Connection

### **Description and configuration**

* To talk to Arduino, you’ll need a computer connected to Arduino using serial port. (*if you want to talk through wifi, you could use websockets [experimental feature])
* In a multiplayer session, only the user running in the Unity Editor is actually talking to the Arduino; everyone else gets/sends data through the [data channels](./3.1_Data_and_Channels.md)
* Configuring the serial port:
  * The computer’s serial port is configured through the “**ConfigurationProfile**” object.
  * When plugging a new arduino you will need to update the port in the configuration profile, to match what is in the Arduino IDE (on Mac this includes /dev/tty..)
* Configuring the data channels:
  * Unity will send/receive data according to what channels are listed in the **ConfigurationProfile**

  * If you want more channels to be connected to/from Arduino, you will need to add them to the Arduino_channels_from_arduino and Arduino_channels_to_arduino lists in the **ConfigurationProfile **object

### **Messages between Arduino and Unity:**

* Messages to/from Arduino are always sent through the com port in the form of “:X:V” where X is channel id (ex: C1) and V is a value from 0-1024. (ex: “:C4:123”)
* The provided Arduino code makes it easy to send/receive data with Unity, but if you want to do it manually you can use simple serial communication
* Sending from Arduino to Unity: 
  * In the Arduino code, using Serial.println(“:C4:555”) will tell Unity that the C4 channel’s value should be 555. 
  * On reception of a new value from Arduino, the channel’s AtomicDataModel will be updated (assuming the channel is listed in the ArduinoCommManager).
* Sending: 
  * From Unity, you can use SerialController to send “:C3:222”, and the Arduino will receive this value. 
  * In the Unity project, when a channel’s ADM model is updated, it is automatically sent to Arduino (assuming the channel is listed in the ArduinoCommManager).
  * Known bugs: there are issues when Unity tries to send too much data; see section below.

**Known issues**

* When sending too much continuous data from Unity to Arduino, the data may be lost or may be received as wrong values (ex: super big or low numbers). If this happens, reduce the amount of channels / data that you send from Unity to Arduino. The connection from Arduino to Unity doesn’t seem to be affected.
