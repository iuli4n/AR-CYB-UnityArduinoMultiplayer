### Photon basics

* Read about Photon Unity Networking: [https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/pun/current/getting-started/pun-intro](https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/pun/current/getting-started/pun-intro) 
* Connectivity: 
  * Photon connects multiple users through a cloud service. All users need to be connected to the internet, not necessarily on the same local network.
* Synchronization:
  * Networked data is synchronized between all users by Photon, through PhotonViews.
  * See [documentation about Photon](./3.6_Photon_Synchronization_of_Custom_Data.md) for more details about synchronizing data
* Ownership:
  * Only one user controls a PhotonView at one time. Only they can change its values. This user is called the ‘owner’ of the PhotonView.
  * This means when another user wants to change the data, they need to request ownership first.

### Data models basics

* Summary: Data in our project flows through named entities called channels. A channel can get data from a Hololens or from the PC or from Arduino or all of the above. Channel data can be controlled in a variety of ways (ex: knobs, buttons) and displayed in a variety of ways (ex: graphs, text, colors)
* Data is stored/synchronized through **AtomicDataModel**(ADM) objects. Each of these holds a value (typically float), which is automatically synchronized by Photon to all users.

  * ^ this figure shows a simplified view of an ADM object being shared by multiple users
  * 
* When one user changes an ADM model value, that model is synchronized by Photon to all other users. An ADM value can only be changed by the user who is the current owner of the PhotonView.

  * ^ this figure is more accurate: in reality all users have a local ADM object, which Photon synchronizes through the PhotonViews that have the same ID
* 
* Channels:
  * Channels allow easy access to sensor data. Channels are basically labels for specific ADM objects. 
  * They are stored in the “CHANNELS and MODELS” gameobject and accessed through the **ChannelManager** class.
  * Some channels come from Arduino (see Arduino Connection section below), and some are within the Unity project (some of these are automatically simulated by the “**SimulatedChannels**” gameobject; and some are manually controlled, possibly through “**ManualDataChannel**” prefabs)
* Simulated Channels
  * Only the user running in the UNITY EDITOR controls these channels. No other users will be generating these signals.
  * They are configured through the **ConfigurationProfile** object (as described below)
* Arduino Channels
  * Some of the data in channels could come from the Arduino, as configured in the **ConfigurationProfile** object. (Please see the [Arduino documentation](./3.2_Arduino_Connection.md) for how to connect/disconnect channels from the Arduino)
* **AtomicDataSwitches**(ADS) are objects that look like AtomicDataModels but they actually can provide values from with different channels. For example, ADS pointed at channel C1 will act like the ADM model associated with C1; if we point it at C2 it acts like the ADM model associated with C2. It's basically a way of accessing data from an ADM, but it can be switched at runtime to different channels.

### Simulated Channels

* Unity can generate simulated data. It can be configured via the **ConfigurationProfile** object, to send simulated data on any channel:

* The way this works is, there's a “**SimulatedChannels**” gameobject generates fake data into several channels.

* * 1: sawtooth spiky 
  * 2: sine wave
  * 3: square wave
  * 4: constantly increasing
